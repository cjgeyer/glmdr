Description: Exponential family generalized linear models (binomial, poisson,
    multinomial, and product multinomial response) done right in the sense
    that solutions "at infinity" (in terms of canonical parameters) or
    "on the boundary" (in terms of mean value parameters) are dealt with
    correctly.  Functions for doing valid hypothesis tests and confidence
    intervals even in "solutions at infinity" cases are included.
